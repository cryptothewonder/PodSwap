What do we need?

1. We need a 'Feed' for every category.

2. It needs to reveal the person's email when the envelope button is pressed.

<!-- 3. We need to be able to post something without needing the image file.  -->

4. Style it a tiny bit so it doesn't look too much like the logo.

5. Pricing.  Although I don't think this needs to be a seperate thing.  but maybe just to be fancy

Maybe

1. Maybe a completed button

2. Two spaces, one for guest one for host.
