<!-- Where I left off, Currently decided to switch to an ejs, so I began that process.  Then it became clear that I should have done that from the start. Then it became clear I should have done React from the start.  Which was what I was thinking so why did I stray? -->

<!-- Now, I'm trying to render the data through the ejs template, but it feels like a waste of time because, guess what?  It should just be done via React.  So leave this note and work on something else for today and come back to this tomorrow. -->
